# Final Project Description

Our final project is an app building an online community where people in Waltham get updated information on COVID-19, food, houses for rent. 

For Housing, it will be in the form of a forum where users can fill out a form with info about their house that they want to lease.
And the info will be posted and other users can see it and contact the leaser. And user can find a list of all the available housing and search for what they want.

For Restaurant, we have selected some famous restaurant in Waltham and upload their information in this page, so users can check whether they are open or not.

For COVID-19, we fetched the data from covidtracking.com and choose some data to present on the page, also we added a search function so that user can use to find the 
information they need. And the data will be updated every day.

For login, we used google authentication to verify user and store their data seperately.
